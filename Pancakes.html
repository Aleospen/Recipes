                                     <p>In Japan, okonomiyaki are made from flour, egg, cabbage and a choice of ingredients.</p> 
                                     <p>Oyaki are pancakes often stuffed with anko, eggplant, or nozawana.</p> 
                                     <p>Dorayaki are a sort of sandwich made from Western-style pancakes and anko. Sweet crepes are also very popular.</p>  
                                     <p>The Japanese have also created a souffl√©-style cooked-in rings-pancake, which is taller and fluffier than the American pancakes.</p>    
                                     <p>It is inspired by, and found in Singapore, Toronto, Australia, and the United Kingdom.</p>
