        Ramen is one of those foods that has taken on a life of its own. 
            While many don't know how ramen became such an instant hit with anime fans outside of Japan, it may be due to the popular long-running series Naruto. 
            Ramen was not only seen as food, but also a symbol of friendship, family, and happiness. 
            Japanese ramen is made of broth, noodles, and different toppings. 
            If there's one anime food that any foodie must try, it's ramen!
